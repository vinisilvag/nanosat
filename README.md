# nanosat

An almost-efficient implementation of the Conflit-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) framework for solving SAT problems in Rust.

This project was developed for learning purposes based on a project I previously worked on at UFMG for the *Theory and Practice of SMT Solving* course.

## Current progress

- [ ] CI
- [ ] Lexer and parser for DIMACS inputs
- [ ] CDCL basic architecture
- [ ] 2-watched literals
- [ ] VSIDS heuristic
- [ ] Benchmark set
- [ ] Evaluation against MiniSAT
